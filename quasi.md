# Notes on quasi experiments

We are going to talk about common design and studies that have relied on quasi-experiment. From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-experiment):

> A quasi-experiment is an empirical interventional study used to estimate the causal impact of an intervention on target population without random assignment.

This might seems irrelevant if you can run large A/B testing. Interestingly, this might not always be possible. There is an interesting post by Netflix on [quasi-experiment](https://netflixtechblog.com/quasi-experimentation-at-netflix-566b57d2e362).
